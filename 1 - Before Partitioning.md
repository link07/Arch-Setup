# Installing Part 1 - Before Partitioning

> Note: You may find it easier to skip this, go to partitioning, do that in [GParted live](http://gparted.org/), and then come back and do this

1. Get the [arch image](https://www.archlinux.org/download/).
1. Put it on a usb ([dd](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_flash_installation_media) or [yumi](https://www.pendrivelinux.com/yumi-multiboot-usb-creator/) (use the UEFI version of yumi if you want to install using systemd-boot / UEFI)
1. reboot computer with usb drive in, select usb from bios / boot menu
1. You should boot into the Arch image.
    * if your screen instead looks corrupted, reboot and hit 'e' on the boot manager screen and add "nomodeset" to the end.
        * If you don't see one, shut off the computer, mount the install drive on a different one (e.g. `sudo mount /dev/sdX2 /mnt`) and edit the line `initrd  /EFI/archiso/archiso.img` in `/mnt/loader/entries/archiso-x86_64.conf` to `initrd  /EFI/archiso/archiso.img nomodeset`
1. See if your in UEFI mode by running: `ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars`, if the directory has contents your in UEFI mode.  If not, don't use systemd-boot, use grub instead.
1. run `load-keys [country e.g. us]`. The default is the us, see available ones in `ls /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/**/*.map.gz`, you might have to change the font if some characters don't display, through `etfont lat9w-16` or other font.
1. connect to the internet, if your using ethernet, see if it's already working through `ping google.com`
    * if your not connected, try `ip addr` to see currently connected network interfaces
        * check `lspci -k` and `dmesg` to see a list of drivers, look for "Network controller", specifically the kernel module line, if you don't see it, it's not detected
    * using wifi
        * get wifi interface from above step, and then run `wifi-menu -o [device name]`
        * if that doesn't connect, `ip link set [device name] up`, scan for access points `iw dev interface scan | less`, connect to the wifi through wpa_supplicant, `wpa_supplicant -B -i wlan0 -c <(wpa_passphrase "your_SSID" "your_key")`, remove -B to check to make sure it connects, as that sends the process to the background.  Then start the dhcp service on the interface to get a ip address, `systemctl restart dhcpcd.service`
        * Check [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wireless_network_configuration) for more help.
2. Partitioning time, go to `2 - LVM` if your using [Logical Volume manager](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/LVM), or `2 - Standard` for normal partitioning
