# Installing Part 3 - Pacstrap and Chroot

> This assumes that Part 2 is already done, and your sitting on the command prompt with your partitions mount to /mnt.

1. run ```pacstrap /mnt base base-devel```.
1. Make fstab with ```genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab```
1. Chroot into the new install, ```arch-chroot /mnt /bin/bash```
1. If you have an intel cpu: install intel-ucode: ```pacman -Sy intel-ucode```, you may always want to install ```vim``` at the same time
1. Uncomment ```en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8``` (or your locale, you can uncomment multiple) in ```/etc/locale.gen``` and then run ```locale-gen``` and then run ```echo LANG=en_US.UTF-8 > /etc/locale.conf``` (replace en_US.UTF-8 with your locale).
    * if you set your keyboard earlier (to anything non-us), make those changes perminent in by editing ```/etc/vconsole.conf``` to include ```KEYMAP=[keymap setting]``` and, after a newline ```FONT=[font setting]```
1. Select a timezone, ```tzselect``` to find the timezone to use, and then ```ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/[zone]/[subzone] /etc/localtime```, you may need to use ```ln -sf``` instead.
1. Set your hardware clock, ```hwclock --systohc --utc```, this will "break" windows time if you are dual booting, see [this](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Time#UTC_in_Windows) to "fix" it
    * run `timedatectl` and see if the time is correct.  If it's not, either set it manually, or (this is what's recommended) enable syncing through NTP by running `timedatectl set-ntp true`.  (NTP may be enabled by default, but it has been observed to be off on at least one machine)
1. IF you used LVM in step 2
    * If you are using systemd (all new Arch installs are), replace ``udev`` with ```systemd``` and add ```sd-lvm2``` before ```filesystems``` on the HOOKS= line of ```/etc/mkinitcpio.conf```
    * If you are using non-systemd init (for some reason), add ```lvm2``` to the above file
    * Then run ```mkinitcpio -p linux```
1. set up bootloader (systemd-boot), ```bootctl install```, then configure it
    * Set ```/boot/loader/loader.conf``` to (each bullet point is a new line)
        * ```default arch```
        * ```timeout 5```
        * ```editor 0```
    * Create /boot/loader/entries/arch.conf
        * ```title   Arch Linux```
        * ```linux   /vmlinuz-linux```
        * IF you have an intel cpu add: ```initrd   /intel-ucode.img```
        * ```initrd /initramfs-linux.img```
        * ```options   root=[READ BELOW]```
            * IF you used lvm for part 2, set ```options root=``` to the location of your root partition logical volume, e.g. ```/dev/mapper/VolGroup00-rootpart```
            * Otherwise, find your UUID by first knowing your /dev/sdXn of your root partition (use ```fdisk -l``` to find it), and then ```ls /dev/disk/by-partuuid -l``` and finding which uuid -> to your sdXn.  Write that down and edit that the options line to be ```options root=PARTUUID=[your part uuid]``` to it
            * If you have an nvidia graphics card, you may want to add ``nomodeset`` to the options, the nvidia drivers should fix this, but we don't install these until reboot
1. Set your hostname in ```/etc/hostname```, set the file to the name, e.g. ```DesktopArch```
1. enable the dhcpcd service to ensure we get an ip on reboot, ```systemctl enable dhcpcd.service```
1. set the root password ```passwd```
1. ```exit``` to exit the Chroot, ```umount -R /mnt``` to unmount everything, and then ```reboot``` and pull out your usb drive
1. Continue to 4 - After rebooting if reboot was successful, otherwise 3b - Fixing failed boot if it wasn't
