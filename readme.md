# How to install / get an Arch install up and running.

Most of the stuff for this pulls from the archived [Beginners Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php?title=Beginners%27_guide&oldid=446844), [Installation guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide), and other Arch wiki locations.  A few are from stack overflow / other locations, I try to note those where I remember to.
